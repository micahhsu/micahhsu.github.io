I built a 5 degree of freedom robotic arm for [SC Robotics](https://saddlebackcollegerobotics.com/), my college mars rover team, competing in the [University Rover Challenge](https://urc.marssociety.org/home). The design was based on a previous generation arm, but I revised the structure and designed a brand new end effector.

First, a video (0:45 for the arm):
