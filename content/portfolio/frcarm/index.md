In high school, I was part of an award winning [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team. [Team 3476: Code Orange](https://www.teamcodeorange.com/). In the 2023 season, I designed a belt-driven telescoping "arm" that could extend up to 19 inches in 0.5 seconds.

Here is our reveal video:

## Prototyping
Each season starts with prototyping, and I experimented with lots of different mechanisms for this telescope. One of them used a constant force spring for extension:

We eventually decided against this design because although it is fast, it only allows the telescope to be fully extended or fully retracted, with no in-between positions.

### Design
After deciding on a belt-drive design from prototyping, I had to figure the very complex geometry for this robot. Let's just say, given the constraints of the robot size and the desired extension, I really learned how to make good sketches.

Some other highlights of this design include the see-through pocketing (which took me almost 5 straight hours one night!) and a fish, for fun!

## Manufacturing
I directed the manufacturing of this arm, making all the drawings for parts, giving them to the manufacturing team, and keeping track of a manufacturing list. Here are some photos of the process:
